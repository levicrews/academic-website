Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at [UCLA](https://economics.ucla.edu/).
My research focuses on **macroeconomics**, **spatial economics**,
and **international trade**,
with a particular focus on how the spatial allocation of economic activity
affects macro aggregates and welfare in the long run.

<br>

Before UCLA, I was an IES Postdoctoral Fellow at
[Princeton University](https://ies.princeton.edu/) for AY 2023-24.
I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the [University of Chicago](https://economics.uchicago.edu/) in 2023.

My CV is available [here](https://www.levicrews.com/files/crews-cv.pdf).

UCLA grad students can [book a meeting with me](https://calendar.app.google/2jaMbQ2ewDoQnvac9).

        Cities have long been thought to drive economic growth. Despite this, analyses of spatial policies have largely ignored the effects of such policies on growth. In this paper, I develop a spatial endogenous growth model in which heterogeneous agents make forward-looking migration decisions and human capital investments over the life cycle. Local externalities in the human capital investment technology drive both agglomeration and growth. I show that, along a balanced growth path, the growth rate depends on the spatial distribution of human capital, making it sensitive to spatial policies. I calibrate the model to data on U.S. metropolitan areas and show that it can rationalize the faster wage growth of workers in big cities, as well as other key patterns in life-cycle wage profiles, migration decisions, and city characteristics. Because workers accumulate human capital at different rates depending on where they live, the model provides an environment in which spatial policy can not just attract skilled workers, but produce them, too. I find that policies that further concentrate skilled workers in large cities are growth-enhancing.

        This paper examines the consequences of international trade for long-run water resources and agricultural productivity. We use a large collection of global spatial data to show that---despite the widespread market failure caused by open access to water as an input with no market price---water-intensive agricultural activity is highly concentrated in water abundant locations, with few exceptions. We use a dynamic spatial equilibrium model of agricultural trade and water resources to quantify the policy consequences of this fact. Model counterfactuals show that international trade in agriculture prevents severe depletion of global water resources and accompanying long-run productivity declines, especially in dry places, by enabling specialization to follow comparative advantage. However, some observed trade liberalization episodes worsen depletion by exacerbating existing inefficiencies.

        The quantity of water within Earth and its atmosphere is fixed over time, but water available for human consumption evolves dynamically. We use globally comprehensive geospatial data to establish stylized facts about recent changes in global water resources and their potential implications for human welfare. We show that the net change in water volume on arable lands&mdash;which account for 90% of human water consumption&mdash;is almost exactly zero. Rapid water loss is concentrated in regions with large populations, low existing water resources, and low agronomic potential. Incorporating trade data shows that water-scarce regions are net importers of water-intensive goods.

        This paper examines the conventional wisdom that promoting consumption of locally produced food reduces greenhouse gas emissions. We start by exploring the partial equilibrium consequences of a single consumer's sourcing decisions using existing data on emissions from shipping along with a new high-resolution global spatial dataset containing scientific estimates of crop-wise emissions from agricultural production. Initial exploration suggests that the spatial variation in production emissions from agriculture is substantial relative to the emissions from shipping. Next, we will use a global model of production, consumption, and trade in agriculture to investigate the general equilibrium consequences of varying the level of globalization. We plan to use the model to compare global agricultural emissions under existing policy to a scenario that imposes autarky on all local regions, and to an alternative scenario with much greater openness to trade.

        This paper investigates how trade policy affects stability in food supply and food prices. We show that openness to trade exerts two competing forces on volatility: (i) diversifying supply across many countries reduces the exposure of local consumers to domestic or regional shocks and (ii) relying on imports for consumption of a necessary good creates vulnerability to geopolitical risk or trade barriers erected in response to instability. We use global panel data on agricultural production, prices, trade flows, trade policy, and weather to examine how trade barriers respond endogenously to agricultural supply shocks and explore the domestic and international transmission of price fluctuations. We plan to use a model of production, consumption, and trade in agriculture to study optimal trade policy for promoting food supply stability in countries facing endogenous trade barriers and stochastic shocks to productivity.
