Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at [UCLA](https://economics.ucla.edu/).
My research focuses on **macroeconomics**, **spatial economics**,
and **international trade**,
with a particular focus on how the spatial allocation of economic activity
affects macro aggregates and welfare in the long run.

<br>

Before UCLA, I was an IES Postdoctoral Fellow at
[Princeton University](https://ies.princeton.edu/) for AY 2023-24.
I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the [University of Chicago](https://economics.uchicago.edu/) in 2023.

My CV is available [here](https://www.levicrews.com/files/crews-cv.pdf).

UCLA grad students can [book a meeting with me](https://calendar.app.google/ouW4CBc6e7ohtGgz6).

        Cities have long been thought to drive economic growth. Despite this, analyses of spatial policies have largely ignored the effects of such policies on growth. In this paper, I develop a spatial endogenous growth model in which heterogeneous agents make forward-looking migration decisions and human capital investments over the life cycle. Local externalities in the human capital investment technology drive both agglomeration and growth. I show that, along a balanced growth path, the growth rate depends on the spatial distribution of human capital, making it sensitive to spatial policies. I calibrate the model to data on U.S. metropolitan areas and show that it can rationalize the faster wage growth of workers in big cities, as well as other key patterns in life-cycle wage profiles, migration decisions, and city characteristics. Because workers accumulate human capital at different rates depending on where they live, the model provides an environment in which spatial policy can not just attract skilled workers, but produce them, too. I find that policies that further concentrate skilled workers in large cities are growth-enhancing.

        Over 90% of global water use occurs in agricultural production, which is subjective to two pervasive distortions: (i) incomplete property rights for farmers accessing water and (ii) subsidies, taxes, and tariffs affecting agricultural output. This paper combines a rich collection of global geospatial data with a dynamic spatial equilibrium model to quantify the impact of agricultural and trade policies on regional water scarcity and welfare. In the data, we show that water-intensive crops concentrate highly in water-abundant locations, implying a strong role for comparative advantage in governing global water use, though a small number of regions with very water-intensive production are losing water rapidly over time. In the model, we capture production, consumption, and trade in agriculture across many countries and crops, as well as the dynamic evolution of local water stocks as farmers extract from the common pool resource. We calibrate the model to match observed global patterns of agricultural production and hydrological trends and use it to conduct counterfactual simulations of alternative policy regimes. We find that eliminating international trade in agriculture would dramatically increase water depletion across most of the world, and especially so in drier food-importing regions, resulting in large reductions in welfare over time. In contrast, other observed and hypothetical incremental agricultural policy liberalizations have mixed effects that vary greatly across locations, suggesting nuance in implications for policy.

        The quantity of water within Earth and its atmosphere is fixed over time, but water available for human consumption evolves dynamically. We use globally comprehensive geospatial data to establish stylized facts about recent changes in global water resources and their potential implications for human welfare. We show that the net change in water volume on arable lands&mdash;which account for 90% of human water consumption&mdash;is almost exactly zero. Rapid water loss is concentrated in regions with large populations, low existing water resources, and low agronomic potential. Incorporating trade data shows that water-scarce regions are net importers of water-intensive goods.

        This paper examines the conventional wisdom that promoting consumption of locally produced food reduces greenhouse gas emissions. We start by exploring the partial equilibrium consequences of a single consumer's sourcing decisions using existing data on emissions from shipping along with a new high-resolution global spatial dataset containing scientific estimates of crop-wise emissions from agricultural production. Initial exploration suggests that the spatial variation in production emissions from agriculture is substantial relative to the emissions from shipping. Next, we will use a global model of production, consumption, and trade in agriculture to investigate the general equilibrium consequences of varying the level of globalization. We plan to use the model to compare global agricultural emissions under existing policy to a scenario that imposes autarky on all local regions, and to an alternative scenario with much greater openness to trade.

        This paper investigates how trade policy affects stability in food supply and food prices. We show that openness to trade exerts two competing forces on volatility: (i) diversifying supply across many countries reduces the exposure of local consumers to domestic or regional shocks and (ii) relying on imports for consumption of a necessary good creates vulnerability to geopolitical risk or trade barriers erected in response to instability. We use global panel data on agricultural production, prices, trade flows, trade policy, and weather to examine how trade barriers respond endogenously to agricultural supply shocks and explore the domestic and international transmission of price fluctuations. We plan to use a model of production, consumption, and trade in agriculture to study optimal trade policy for promoting food supply stability in countries facing endogenous trade barriers and stochastic shocks to productivity.
