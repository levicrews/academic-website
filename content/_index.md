Welcome! I am an IES Postdoctoral Fellow at
[Princeton University](https://ies.princeton.edu/).
My research focuses on **macroeconomics**, **spatial economics**,
and **international trade**,
with a particular focus on how the spatial distribution of economic activity
affects macro aggregates and economic welfare in the long run.

<br>

Following the 2023-24 academic year,
I will join [UCLA Economics](https://economics.ucla.edu/)
as an Assistant Professor.

<br>

My CV is available [here](https://www.levicrews.com/files/crews-cv.pdf).

Reach me at [lcrews[at]princeton.edu](mailto:lcrews@princeton.edu).

Princeton graduate students and thesis advisees can [book a meeting with me](https://calendar.app.google/ouW4CBc6e7ohtGgz6).
