abstract: Cities have long been thought to drive economic growth, but analyses of spatial policy have largely ignored the effects of such policies on growth. In this paper, I develop a spatial endogenous growth model in which heterogeneous agents make forward-looking migration decisions and human capital investments over the life cycle. Local externalities in human capital investment drive both agglomeration and growth. I show that the growth rate depends on the spatial distribution of human capital, making it sensitive to spatial policies. I calibrate the model to data on U.S. metropolitan areas. I then solve for the allocation that would be chosen by a national planner. I find that, relative to the decentralized allocation, the planner's allocation features more concentration in the largest city, higher levels of human capital overall, and faster growth. Commonly-proposed place-based policies fall far short of or even oppose the planner's policies.
