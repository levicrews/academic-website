## TA materials

#### Spatial Economics (PhD)

I wrote two assignments for Esteban Rossi-Hansberg's PhD field course at UChicago. Each one guided students through the process of developing, quantifying, and solving spatial models in order to answer interesting economic questions.

- [Assignment 1: Working with Quantitative Spatial Models](../files/e33550_ps1.pdf)
- [Assignment 2: A Dynamic Spatial Model of Climate Change](../files/e33550_ps2.pdf)

#### Theory of Income III (PhD)

I wrote one [midterm exam](../files/e33200_midterm2.pdf) for Fernando Alvarez's PhD core course in macroeconomics at UChicago.

#### International Trade (U)

I wrote a number of problem set and exam questions for Felix Tintelnot's undergraduate elective on international trade at UChicago. I also set up and moderated a Slack channel for the course to help facilitate student participation in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic.

- [Problem Set 1](../files/winter2021_ps1.pdf) with [solutions](../files/winter2021_ps1_solutions.pdf)
- [Problem Set 3](../files/winter2021_ps3.pdf) with [solutions](../files/winter2021_ps3_solutions.pdf)
- [Problem Set 5](../files/winter2021_ps5.pdf) with [solutions](../files/winter2021_ps5_solutions.pdf)
- [Midterm Exam](../files/winter2021_midterm.pdf) with [solutions](../files/winter2021_midterm_solutions.pdf) and [additional TFUs](../files/winter2021_midtermTFU.pdf)
- [Final Exam](../files/winter2021_final1.pdf) with [solutions](../files/winter2021_final1_solutions.pdf)

#### Math Camp (PhD)

I contributed two supplementary lectures on macro methods during our PhD math camp at UChicago.

- [Ordinary Differential Equations](../files/session-ode.pdf)
- [Computational Dynamic Programming](../files/session-comp.pdf)

#### Reading Groups

The first two presentations were written for Greg Kaplan's macro reading group at UChicago. Each was designed to take less than 30 minutes. The third presentation was written for a student-run reading group in trade and spatial economics. It was designed to take less than one hour.
