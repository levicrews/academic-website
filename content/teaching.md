## TA materials

#### Spatial Economics (PhD)

I wrote two assignments for Esteban Rossi-Hansberg's PhD field course at UChicago. Each one guided students through the process of developing, quantifying, and solving spatial models in order to answer interesting economic questions.

- [Assignment 1: Working with quantitative spatial models](../files/e33550_ps1.pdf)
- [Assignment 2: A dynamic spatial model of climate change](../files/e33550_ps2.pdf)

#### Theory of Income III (PhD)

I wrote one [midterm exam](../files/e33200_midterm2.pdf) for Fernando Alvarez's PhD core course in macroeconomics at UChicago.

#### International Trade (U)

I wrote a number of problem set and exam questions for Felix Tintelnot's undergraduate elective on international trade at UChicago.

- [Problem Set 1](../files/winter2021_ps1.pdf) with [solutions](../files/winter2021_ps1_solutions.pdf)
- [Problem Set 3](../files/winter2021_ps3.pdf) with [solutions](../files/winter2021_ps3_solutions.pdf)
- [Problem Set 5](../files/winter2021_ps5.pdf) with [solutions](../files/winter2021_ps5_solutions.pdf)
- [Midterm Exam](../files/winter2021_midterm.pdf) with [solutions](../files/winter2021_midterm_solutions.pdf) + [additional TFUs](../files/winter2021_midtermTFU.pdf)
- [Final Exam](../files/winter2021_final1.pdf) with [solutions](../files/winter2021_final1_solutions.pdf)

#### Math Camp (PhD)

I contributed two supplementary lectures on macro methods during our PhD math camp at UChicago.

- [Ordinary differential equations](../files/session-ode.pdf)
- [Computational dynamic programming](../files/session-comp.pdf)
