I am a PhD candidate in economics at the University of Chicago.
My research agenda addresses how the spatial distribution of economic activity
affects economic welfare in the long run.
My recent work examines how the allocation of workers across cities in the US
affects the rate of aggregate growth through localized idea diffusion.
