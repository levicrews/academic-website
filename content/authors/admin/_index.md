Welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the [University of Chicago](https://economics.uchicago.edu/).
My research focuses on **macroeconomics**, **spatial economics**,
and **international trade**,
with a particular focus on how the spatial distribution of economic activity
affects economic welfare in the long run.

I will spend 2023-24 as a Postdoctoral Fellow
in the International Economics Section at [Princeton](https://ies.princeton.edu/),
after which I will join the Economics Department at [UCLA](https://economics.ucla.edu/)
as an Assistant Professor.

My CV is available [here](https://www.levicrews.com/files/crews-cv.pdf).

Reach me at [lgcrews[at]uchicago.edu](mailto:lgcrews@uchicago.edu).
